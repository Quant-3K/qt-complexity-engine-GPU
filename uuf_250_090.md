## 1. Sanity & Consistency Checks

From `summary.json`:

- `E_C`      = 0.868297  
- `E_H`      = 0.120837  
- `E_kappa`  = 0.844114  
- `Var_H`    = 0.014133  
- `K_QT`     = 0.763186  
- `E_Beta`   = 5000.0  
- `Max_Beta` = 5000.0  

From `metrics.csv` (`count = 1000` rows):

- mean(C)      ≈ 0.868297  
- mean(H_norm) ≈ 0.120837  
- mean(KQ)     ≈ 0.763186  
- mean(kappa)  ≈ 0.844114  

The CSV means match the JSON aggregates to numerical precision. **The summary is a faithful aggregate of the raw time-series.**

### 1.1 Canonical relation check

We test the canonical Quant‑Trika relation

> KQ ≈ C · (1 − H_norm)

by computing `KQ_pred = C * (1 − H_norm)` at each time step and the residual `KQ − KQ_pred`.

Residual statistics over all 1000 steps:

- mean residual ≈ -0.000  
- std residual  ≈ 0.000  
- min residual  ≈ -0.000  
- max residual  ≈ 0.000  

These are all at the 10⁻¹⁶–10⁻¹⁷ scale, i.e. **pure floating-point roundoff**. For this instance we can treat

> **KQ(t) = C(t) · (1 − H_norm(t))**

as an exact implementation of the canonical formula.

### 1.2 Range sanity

From `metrics.csv`:

- C      ∈ [0.833803, 0.888263]  
- H_norm ∈ [0.000000, 0.398004]  
- KQ     ∈ [0.520577, 0.881643]  
- kappa  ∈ [0.831055, 0.860933]  

All metrics lie in expected physical ranges. There are **no NaNs, infinities, or obvious outliers.**

---

## 2. Global Metrics (JSON view)

Using `summary.json`:

- **Structural Quality (E_C) ≈ 0.8683**  
  Structure is **high** and comparable to other algebraic SAT instances (C880mul, alu4mul). The constraint graph has a strong, non‑random pattern.

- **Entropy (E_H) ≈ 0.1208, Var_H ≈ 0.0141**  
  The **mean entropy is very low (~0.12)**, but the variance is non‑negligible. This means the system spends a large fraction of time in ultra‑low entropy states, with occasional excursions to higher entropy (up to ≈0.40).

- **Curvature (E_kappa) ≈ 0.8441**  
  Curvature is **high (~0.844)** but slightly below the most rigid cases (like `am_9_9` around 0.996). The geometry is clearly constrained but not maximally stiff.

- **Coherence (K_QT) ≈ 0.7632**  
  Coherence is **very high (~0.76)**. This is by far the highest average KQ among the five instances we analyzed. It indicates a regime of **global order and stability**.

- **Beta:** `E_Beta = Max_Beta = 5000` — the engine again runs at a fixed large β with no annealing.

**High‑level picture:** `uuf250-090` lives in a **low‑entropy, high‑coherence regime** with high structural quality and substantial but not maximal curvature. It is a “clean”, ordered problem instance from the QT perspective.

---

## 3. Time‑Series Structure (CSV view)

### 3.1 Overall descriptive statistics

From `metrics.csv`:

- **C (structural quality)**  
  - mean ≈ 0.8683  
  - std  ≈ 0.0107  
  - min/max ≈ [0.8338, 0.8883]  

  → C is **consistently high (0.834–0.888)** with only modest spread. Structure never deteriorates.

- **H_norm (normalized entropy)**  
  - mean ≈ 0.1208  
  - std  ≈ 0.1189  
  - min/max ≈ [0.0000, 0.3980]  

  → H_norm spends a large amount of time extremely close to 0, with excursions up to ≈0.398. On average entropy is low, but its variance indicates **intermittent bursts of disorder.**

- **KQ (coherence)**  
  - mean ≈ 0.7632  
  - std  ≈ 0.1022  
  - min/max ≈ [0.5206, 0.8816]  

  → KQ is **overall high (0.52–0.88)** with mean ≈0.763. Even in the worst moments coherence remains >0.52; there is no approach to collapse.

- **kappa (curvature)**  
  - mean ≈ 0.8441  
  - std  ≈ 0.0060  
  - min/max ≈ [0.8311, 0.8609]  

  → κ ranges roughly from 0.831 to 0.861 with small variance, indicating a **stable but not ultra‑rigid manifold.**

### 3.2 Extremal coherence events

- **Maximum KQ**  
  - index = 328  
  - C ≈ 0.8826  
  - H_norm ≈ 0.001118  
  - KQ ≈ 0.8816  
  - kappa ≈ 0.8532  

  Here entropy is almost zero and structure is high, so KQ ≈ C. This is an **almost perfectly ordered configuration**.

- **Minimum KQ**  
  - index = 858  
  - C ≈ 0.8601  
  - H_norm ≈ 0.3947  
  - KQ ≈ 0.5206  
  - kappa ≈ 0.8439  

  Here entropy spikes to ≈0.395 while structure and curvature remain comparable. Coherence drops to ≈0.521 but still stays far from zero — this is as close as the run gets to a “disordered” state.

### 3.3 Segment‑wise dynamics

To see whether the run has distinct phases we split it into three contiguous segments:

1. **Segment 1 — steps 0–332 (333 steps)**  
   - mean(C)   ≈ 0.8621  
   - mean(H)   ≈ 0.0886, std(H) ≈ 0.1093  
   - min/max H ≈ [0.000000, 0.3865]  
   - mean(KQ)  ≈ 0.7851, std(KQ) ≈ 0.0910  
   - mean(kappa) ≈ 0.8477  

   → This segment has **very low mean entropy (~0.089) and the highest coherence (~0.785)**. Entropy spikes are present but relatively rare. Geometry (kappa) is slightly above the global mean.

2. **Segment 2 — steps 333–665 (333 steps)**  
   - mean(C)   ≈ 0.8729  
   - mean(H)   ≈ 0.1142, std(H) ≈ 0.0999  
   - min/max H ≈ [0.0003, 0.3744]  
   - mean(KQ)  ≈ 0.7732, std(KQ) ≈ 0.0870  
   - mean(kappa) ≈ 0.8426  

   → Entropy increases slightly (~0.114) and coherence decreases modestly (~0.773). Curvature decreases compared to Segment 1 but remains high. The system stays in a **low‑entropy coherent regime**, just not as pristine as in Segment 1.

3. **Segment 3 — steps 666–999 (334 steps)**  
   - mean(C)   ≈ 0.8699  
   - mean(H)   ≈ 0.1596, std(H) ≈ 0.1341  
   - min/max H ≈ [0.0003, 0.3980]  
   - mean(KQ)  ≈ 0.7314, std(KQ) ≈ 0.1182  
   - mean(kappa) ≈ 0.8420  

   → Entropy rises further (~0.160) and its variance increases; coherence drops more (~0.731). Geometry softens slightly. This is still a **low‑entropy, high‑coherence phase**, just the “dirtiest” of the three.

**Temporal narrative:** coherence is very high throughout, but there is a gentle drift:
- from **ultra‑clean, almost entropy‑free order** (Segment 1),
- through **slightly noisier but still coherent states** (Segment 2),
- to a **somewhat more entropic yet still highly coherent regime** (Segment 3).

At no point does the system approach the mid‑entropy or high‑entropy regimes seen in `bart30` or `alu4mul`.

### 3.4 Regime occupancy fractions

Using simple thresholds for intuition:

- Fraction of **ultra‑low entropy** steps (H_norm < 0.05): ≈ 0.448 → about 44.8%  
- Fraction of **moderate entropy** steps (0.05 ≤ H_norm ≤ 0.30): ≈ 0.438 → about 43.8%  
- Fraction of **higher entropy** steps (H_norm > 0.30): ≈ 0.114 → about 11.4%  

- Fraction of **high coherence** steps (KQ > 0.80): ≈ 0.513 → about 51.3%  
- Fraction of **mid coherence** steps (0.60 ≤ KQ ≤ 0.80): ≈ 0.379 → about 37.9%  
- Fraction of **lower coherence** steps (KQ < 0.60): ≈ 0.108 → about 10.8%  

So roughly:

- **~45%** of the time the system is in an **ultra‑low‑entropy, near‑perfectly coherent state**.  
- **~44%** in a still low‑entropy, high‑coherence band.  
- Only **~11%** of the time entropy rises above 0.3, and even then KQ never drops below ~0.52.

This confirms that `uuf250-090` is predominantly a **Regime I / I+ instance**.

---

## 4. Regime Classification

Using the coarse regimes:

- Regime I+ — ultra‑low entropy coherence.  
- Regime I  — low‑entropy coherence.  
- Regime II — mid‑entropy oscillation.  
- Regime III — high‑entropy structural stability.  
- Regime IV — extreme‑entropy collapse.

For `uuf250-090` we observe:

- E_H ≈ 0.1208 (very low), with large fraction of steps near H_norm ≈ 0.  
- K_QT ≈ 0.7632 (very high).  
- C and kappa both high and stable.  
- Only a small minority of steps see H_norm > 0.3 and KQ < 0.6.

**Classification:**

> `uuf250-090` lives in **Regime I+ / I — low‑entropy high‑coherence states** throughout the run, with mild excursions toward slightly higher entropy that never threaten global coherence.

There are no genuine transitions to Regime II, III or IV in this run.

## 5. Geometric Relationships and Correlations (Expanded to Full Depth)

This section now provides a **structural, geometric, and dynamical interpretation** of all quantitative relationships among the four core Quant‑Trika observables: `C`, `H_norm`, `KQ`, and `kappa`. The goal is to describe not just the correlations, but the **latent geometry** that gives rise to these patterns.

### 5.1 Canonical Structure: A Two‑Axis Geometry

Quant‑Trika assumes that computational landscapes (including SAT) evolve in a geometry spanned by two dominant directions:

1. **Structural Axis (S‑axis)** — represented by `C` and partially by `kappa`.
2. **Entropic Axis (E‑axis)** — represented by `H_norm`.

`KQ` is *not* an independent axis; it is the **projection of structure onto the entropy‑suppressed manifold**:

> KQ = C · (1 − H_norm)

Because the canonical law holds exactly for this instance, the geometry is extremely clean:
- `C` is a slow background field.
- `H_norm` is the fast oscillatory driver.
- `KQ` is the entropic shadow of structure.
- `kappa` encodes how stiff or flexible the manifold is under these entropic perturbations.

### 5.2 Correlation Matrix — Deep Interpretation

Recall the correlations:
- corr(H_norm, KQ) ≈ **−0.9953** (almost perfect)
- corr(C, KQ) ≈ −0.0522 (nearly zero)
- corr(kappa, KQ) ≈ −0.0226 (nearly zero)
- corr(C, H_norm) ≈ 0.1482 (weak)
- corr(C, kappa) ≈ 0.1774 (weak positive)
- corr(H_norm, kappa) ≈ 0.0388 (none)

#### Interpretation:
- **Entropy dominates the geometry** — KQ is essentially controlled by H_norm.
- **Structure does not respond to entropy** — C remains high even when H_norm spikes.
- **Curvature is decoupled** — κ neither collapses nor spikes during entropic fluctuations.

This indicates that `uuf250-090` sits in a **rigid but entropy-resilient manifold**, where curvature is not strongly modulated by conflict. The geometric stiffness is high enough to hold structure, but not so high that it imposes chaotic constraints.

### 5.3 Geometric Manifold Interpretation

The nearly perfect anti-correlation between H_norm and KQ implies the instance lives on a **1‑dimensional dynamical curve** embedded in a higher-dimensional state space.

The curve is defined by:
- high C
- stable κ
- entropy oscillation
- KQ adjusting deterministically

This is the hallmark of a **coherence‑dominated curvature manifold**, similar to low-noise Ising models.

### 5.4 Implications for SAT Landscape Shape

The geometry suggests:
- basin structure is **wide and smooth**, not fractal;
- entropy spikes correspond to **boundary crossings** between wide basins;
- curvature prevents chaotic drift but allows controlled movement.

This makes `uuf250-090` a geometrically **simple** SAT instance.

### 5.5 Why This Instance Is a Perfect “Training Case” for QT

- Exact canonical law.
- Highly stable structure.
- Decoupled curvature.
- Entropy as the only significant driver.

This is the ideal case for validating theoretical models, because the geometry is extremely clean.

## 6. Practical Interpretation (Expanded)

This section explains the SAT instance **from the viewpoint of a practitioner**, not a theorist. We interpret what the QT metrics imply about solvability, search behavior, and computational difficulty.

### 6.1 Solvability and Search Ease

`uuf250-090` is extremely solvable from the QT viewpoint because:
- coherence is high **over 76% on average**;
- entropy is low **~0.12**;
- structural quality is high **~0.868**;
- curvature is stable and high **~0.844**.

These values indicate a **smooth solution landscape** with one or more large basins of attraction.

### 6.2 Absence of Chaotic Phases

Chaotic search phases correspond to:
- high entropy (>0.7)
- collapsing curvature (κ < 0.5)
- KQ → 0 (coherence collapse)

None of these ever occur.

This means heuristic or local search algorithms would experience **predictable gradient directions**, making it unlikely to get trapped in chaotic local minima.

### 6.3 Interpreting Entropy Bursts

Entropy spikes up to ~0.39 occur in ~11% of steps. These likely correspond to:
- clause clusters with local conflict,
- variable flips that temporarily increase disorder,
- transitions between regional minima.

But because:
- C remains high,
- κ remains stable,
- KQ stays >0.52,

these transitions are **not structurally dangerous**.

### 6.4 Practical Implication for SAT Solvers

A classical SAT solver would observe:
- fast convergence into the main basin,
- occasional detours near basin boundaries,
- but no prolonged thrashing or chaotic wandering.

This aligns with the signature of **easy-to-moderate CNF instances**.

### 6.5 Role of Curvature in Search Stability

High κ ≈ 0.844 prevents the solver from entering flat, undefined regions. This stabilizes:
- clause selection heuristics,
- unit propagation paths,
- variable flipping dynamics.

This instance is ideal for demonstrating how curvature stabilizes search without over-constraining it.

## 7. Cross‑Instance Comparison (Deepened and Systematized)

Here we expand the comparison into a **full geometric taxonomy** across five SAT instances.

### 7.1 Two Global Axes of Complexity

Across all five instances, complexity is dominated by two factors:
1. **Entropy Level (E_H)** — determines turbulence.
2. **Curvature Rigidity (E_kappa)** — determines geometric stability.

Plotting the five instances in this 2D plane yields three major clusters:
- **Coherent Easy Cluster** — `uuf250-090`, `C880mul`
- **Mid-Entropy Cluster** — `bart30`
- **Chaotic/Extreme Cluster** — `alu4mul` (oscillatory), `am_9_9` (collapsed)

### 7.2 Cross‑Instance Ranking by Coherence

| Rank | Instance | K_QT | Interpretation |
|------|----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **uuf250-090** | 0.763 | Pure coherence regime, ideal case. |
| 2 | C880mul | 0.405 | Mid-coherence, stable. |
| 3 | alu4mul | 0.389 | Oscillatory coherence with phase switching. |
| 4 | bart30 | 0.308 | Noisy, mid-entropy landscape. |
| 5 | am_9_9 | 0.005 | Total entropy collapse. |

This ordering mirrors the entropy ranking exactly.

### 7.3 Cross‑Instance Ranking by Entropy

| Rank | Instance | E_H | Regime |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | **am_9_9** | 0.994 | Regime IV — collapse |
| 2 | bart30 | 0.607 | Regime II–III |
| 3 | alu4mul | 0.556 | Regime II–III switching |
| 4 | C880mul | 0.537 | Regime II |
| 5 | **uuf250-090** | 0.121 | Regime I+ |

### 7.4 Cross‑Instance Curvature Geography

Curvature determines how rigidly the SAT formula constrains the search path.

| Instance | E_kappa | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| am_9_9 | 0.9959 | Ultra‑rigid but dominated by entropy collapse |
| alu4mul | 0.9867 | Highly rigid, prone to phase oscillations |
| C880mul | 0.9722 | Rigid, stable mid‑entropy |
| uuf250-090 | 0.8441 | Moderately rigid, extremely stable |
| bart30 | 0.8225 | Most flexible structure |

### 7.5 Structural Quality Comparison

| Instance | E_C |
|----------|------|
| alu4mul | 0.878 |
| C880mul | 0.875 |
| **uuf250-090** | 0.868 |
| am_9_9 | 0.839 |
| bart30 | 0.786 |

This ordering shows that structure alone does **not** imply coherence: `am_9_9` has high C but zero KQ due to extreme entropy.

### 7.6 Full Geometric Archetypes

Each instance can be considered a **geometric archetype** in QT space:

- **uuf250-090 — Coherent Basin Archetype**
  A nearly ideal coherence‑dominated landscape with minimal entropy.

- **C880mul — Stable Mid‑Entropy Archetype**
  Smooth, rigid, modest‑entropy landscape.

- **alu4mul — Oscillatory Phase‑Switching Archetype**
  Alternates between low‑entropy and high‑entropy phases, large Var_H.

- **bart30 — Noisy Structured Archetype**
  High entropy with good structure but moderate coherence.

- **am_9_9 — Collapse Archetype**
  Nearly pure entropy; coherence destroyed.

### 7.7 What This Reveals About the QT Engine

This benchmark suite samples the full QT landscape:
- Ultra‑coherent case (uuf250)
- Stable case (C880)
- Oscillatory case (alu4mul)
- Noisy case (bart30)
- Collapsed case (am_9_9)

This diversity ensures the QT engine is being tested across all known dynamical regimes.

 Practical Interpretation (QT viewpoint)

From the Quant‑Trika perspective, `uuf250-090` looks like:

1. **A highly solvable, well‑behaved SAT landscape.**  
   Strong structure (C ≈ 0.868), low entropy, and high coherence indicate that the formula’s constraint geometry aligns well – there are large basins of consistent assignments.

2. **A benchmark for “best‑case” coherence.**  
   Among the five instances, this one has the **highest average KQ** and spends the most time near H_norm ≈ 0. Many steps essentially realize the ideal relation KQ ≈ C.

3. **Entropy spikes as rare stress tests.**  
   The few moments when H_norm rises above 0.3 and KQ drops toward ~0.52 are **short‑lived perturbations** rather than sustained turbulent phases. They show how the engine behaves when local conflicts appear, but they never destabilize the global structure.

4. **Geometrically: strong but not maximal curvature.**  
   κ ≈ 0.844 is high but not at the ultra‑rigid level of `am_9_9`. This suggests that the formula is structured enough to guide the search effectively, without overly constraining it into narrow chaotic corners.

Overall, `uuf250-090` is an **excellent “easy / coherent” reference instance** for the QT Complexity Engine: it shows what the engine’s metrics look like when the problem is structurally rich, entropy is low, and coherence is consistently high.

## 7. Cross‑Instance Comparison (5‑way)

Using `summary.json` for all five instances:

| Instance ID                             | E_C    | E_H    | E_kappa | Var_H        | K_QT   | Qualitative regime profile                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| alu4mul.miter.shuffled-as.sat03-344     | 0.8782 | 0.5558 | 0.9867 | 0.2222 | 0.3893 | Phase‑switching instance: large Var_H, jumps between low‑entropy coherence and high‑entropy collapse. |
| C880mul.miter.shuffled-as.sat03-348     | 0.8751 | 0.5373 | 0.9722 | 0.0078 | 0.4048 | Stable mid‑entropy, high‑coherence manifold (Regime II → III).                            |
| bart30.shuffled                         | 0.7860 | 0.6075 | 0.8225 | 0.0043 | 0.3084 | Structured but noisy landscape: mid–high entropy, moderate coherence (Regime II–III hybrid). |
| am_9_9.shuffled-as.sat03-365            | 0.8392 | 0.9940 | 0.9959 | 0.0000 | 0.0050 | Extreme‑entropy collapse: H near 1, KQ ≈ 0, no recovery (Regime IV).                       |
| uuf250-090                              | 0.8683 | 0.1208 | 0.8441 | 0.0141 | 0.7632 | Ultra‑low‑entropy, high‑coherence instance (Regime I+ / I), used as “easy” reference.     |

**Δ‑geometry summary:**

- `uuf250-090` and `C880mul` represent **high‑coherence baselines**, with `uuf250-090` being the most ordered (lowest E_H, highest K_QT).  
- `bart30` is a **noisier, less coherent variant** on a still rigid structure.  
- `alu4mul` explores **extreme swings** across regimes (very large Var_H).  
- `am_9_9` is the **pure collapse limit**, with maximal entropy and minimal coherence.

Together, these five instances form a **balanced benchmark suite** for the QT Complexity Engine, covering everything from ultra‑coherent to fully collapsed regimes.
